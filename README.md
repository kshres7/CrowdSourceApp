# CrowdSourceApp
Push Notification using real-time data

# What it does
CrowdSource is an android app and a web service, it provides real-time information regarding different events to the user along with the address of the location. Similarly, its unique feature is that it utilizes the geolocation of the app user and provides push notifications to users about the events happening under the radius of 10 miles.

Just imagine a scenario where you are walking through a certain area and sudden hear a gunshot from somewhere. Firstly, you would try to keep yourself safe and escape from that area. Then, you can quickly access the CrowdSource app and by just speaking about the scenario you can inform other app users and report about the event. Depending on the text analytics and Googleâ€™s geolocation, the app pins the location of the event and informs the audience. Also, it has an additional feature to tag photos as well. This way it not just creates public awareness but can actually help save lives and reduce any sort of casualties.

This app can be used to report any kind of event from an accident to a music concert or even a hackathon event. It is all about public awareness. You get the latest news happening-in near your location faster than CNN, FOX News or any other media. All that is required is just your voice or some descriptions. The data of the user is completely anonymous. Also, there is an option to report on an fake events.
